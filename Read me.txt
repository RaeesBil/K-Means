K-Means Clustering:
K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering, which groups similar data points into clusters based on feature similarity. The algorithm partitions the dataset into a pre-defined number of clusters (k) by minimizing the variance within each cluster. It iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updates the centroids based on the mean of the points within each cluster. K-Means is widely used in market segmentation, image compression, and customer profiling.


Dataset:
This dataset includes information about customers, such as their CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score (a measure of how much they spend). By applying K-Means, we aim to segment the customers into distinct groups based on their income and spending patterns. The findings can help businesses identify customer segments, tailor marketing strategies, and improve customer experience based on specific behavior profiles.
